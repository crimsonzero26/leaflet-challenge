# Unit 15 Homework: Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Background

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. As a new hire, you will be helping them out with an exciting new project!

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your computer .

2. To visualize the data, API from Mapbox is required. To get the key, sign up for an account at https://www.mapbox.com/ and create an API key. 

3. Create a config.js file in the static/js/ directory and create the variable: var API_KEY = "insert your API key here".

4. Run index.html using Google Chrome (Running with other web browsers may lead to errors).

5. Use the image below to confirm that the webpage loaded correctly. Be aware that there may be differences on the data points as the image is using data from 9/22/2022 to 10/22/2022.
